# virtualProjector_Unity
This script enables to compute the projection of a virtual plane using the camera obscura model. 

The rays are projected from the camera position (C) through the virtual plane into the plane located at the origin ([0,0,0]^T) of the coordinate system.

The resulting image on the plane should be distorted according to the camera/projector position (C), but when viewed by the camera perspective they should remain undistorted.
